This is the repo of all the assignments done by me for the SoC project (Un)-Clear.  
The assignments done till now are:  
## Week 1 : OpenCV and Python  
Simple python programs for image manipulation using OpenCV
## Week 2 : Digit Recognizer tensorflow model  
Handwritten digit classifier achieving 97.1% accuracy in a [contest](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer)
## Week 3 : Sketch Colourisation GAN  
GAN using the U-net model as the generator for coloring anime sketch images. 
## Week 4 : Image Upscaling model based on ESRGAN using tensorflow
The final goal of the project. This program implements the [ESRGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00219) model for image upscaling.  
The model has been trained for 250 epochs on the [DIV2K dataset](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/DIV2K/) for performing 4x upscaling.  
The model weights can be downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/pranjalkushwaha/esrgan-final)(Tensorflow format)
